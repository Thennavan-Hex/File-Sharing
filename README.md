## Getting Started

### Uploading Files

1. Visit our website at [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com).
2. Drag and drop your file onto the designated area, or click the "Upload" button.
3. Your file will be securely uploaded to our server.

### Accessing Shared Files via SSH

To access shared files via SSH, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the following command to connect to our server:

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/private-key user@example.com
## File Management

- To update or delete a shared file, simply re-upload the file with the same name. The new version will replace the old one.
- Files will be automatically deleted after a specified period (e.g., 7 days) for security and space management.

You can also organize your shared files into folders for better management. To create a folder:

1. Log in to our website.
2. Click on the "Create Folder" option.
3. Give your folder a name and choose a location.
4. Upload files to your folder for secure sharing.

## Sharing Files

A unique link is generated for each file or folder you upload. You have two sharing options:

1. **Share with Many**: You can make the link public and share it with anyone. Simply copy and send the link to your recipients. Anyone with the link can access the shared files.

2. **Share with Specific Persons**: If you want to restrict access, you can share the link only with specific individuals. Ensure they have the link to access the files securely.

## Security

Ensuring the security of your shared files is our top priority. Here's how we keep your data safe:

- **Data Encryption**: Your files are encrypted both during transmission and storage. This encryption helps protect your files from unauthorized access.

- **SSH Key-Based Authentication**: We use SSH key-based authentication to provide secure access to your shared files. This means that only users with the correct private key can access their files via SSH.

- **Regular Security Audits**: Our system undergoes regular security audits and updates to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We work to stay up-to-date with the latest security practices.

- **User Data Protection**: We respect your privacy. Your personal information and the files you share with us will be handled in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.example.com/privacy-policy).

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Although we do not require user accounts, if you choose to create an account, we offer optional two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.

Please note that while we take every precaution to secure your data, no system can be completely immune to all risks. If you have any security concerns or discover a potential vulnerability, please reach out to us immediately.
